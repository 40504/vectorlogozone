# HackerLogos

I needed consistantly sized logos for various hacker-y languages/tools/services/etc.

## Legal Disclaimer

I am not the copyright/trademark/etc owner of any of these.  Use them at your own risk. 

If you are the owner and do not want your logo here, please let me know (nicely) and I will be glad to remove it.  Just so you know: I am usually using them on a credits page ([example](http://www.numberplanet.com/support/credits.html)), so it might be in your best interests to let me slide.  Alternatively, it would be great if you provided the appropriately sized images yourself.

## File Specifications

* XXX-vertical.png - 94 px high, logo (roughly 64px) on top of styled text
* XXX-32.png - 32 x 32 px, no text
* XXX-horizontal.png - logo next to styled text.  Exact dimensions are not required, but the images' visual "weight" on the page should be roughly similar. Text should be between 21 and 24 px high. Logo can be up to 40 px high.  Ideal width is 120 px, but can range from 88 to 150 px.

Whenever possible, I include the original file with the \_src before the extension (i.e. XXX-vertical_src.png)
