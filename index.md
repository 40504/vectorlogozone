title: Logos for Hackers

I needed consistantly sized logos for various hacker-y languages/tools/services/etc.

## Legal Disclaimer

I am not the copyright/trademark/etc owner of any of these.  Use them at your own risk.

If you are the owner and do not want your logo here, please let me know (nicely) and I will be glad to remove it.  No lawyers necessary: just [submit an issue](https://github.com/fileformat/hackerlogos/issues/new) on github! Just so you know: I am usually using them on a credits page ([example](http://www.numberplanet.com/support/credits.html)), so it might be in your best interests to let me slide.  Alternatively, it would be great if you provided the appropriately sized images yourself.

## Artistic Disclaimer

I am definitely *not* an artist, and generally do not do anything besides resize and rearrange existing artwork.
