title: Logos for Hackers
---

I needed consistantly sized logos for one of [my recent projects](http://www.regexplanet.com/).  While Google Image Search is really quite good, I still had a lot of trouble finding images that were:

 * consistently sized (or vector)
 * transparent background
 * look good on a variety of light backgrounds
 * with type in the correct layout

I ended having to do a fair bit of work to get them looking okay, and figured others might benefit as well.

## Legal Disclaimer

I am not the copyright/trademark/etc owner of any of these.  Use them at your own risk.

If you are the owner and do not want your logo here, please let me know (nicely) and I will be glad to remove it.  No lawyers necessary: just [submit an issue](https://github.com/fileformat/hackerlogos/issues/new) on github! Just so you know: I am usually using them on a credits page ([example](http://www.numberplanet.com/support/credits.html)), so it might be in your best interests to let me slide.  Alternatively, it would be great if you provided the appropriately sized images yourself.

## Artistic Disclaimer

I am definitely *not* an artist, and generally do not do anything besides resize and rearrange existing artwork.
