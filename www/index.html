title: Logos for Hackers
---

<p>I needed consistantly sized logos for one of <a href="http://www.regexplanet.com/">my recent projects</a>.  While Google Image Search is really quite good, I still had a lot of trouble finding images that were:</p>

<ul>
	<li>consistently sized (or vector)</li>
	<li>transparent background</li>
	<li>look good on a variety of light backgrounds</li>
	<li>with type in the correct layout</li>
</ul>

<p>I ended having to do a fair bit of work to get them looking okay, and figured others might benefit as well.</p>

<p>If you are the owner and do not want your logo here, please let me know (nicely) and I will be glad to remove it.  
No lawyers necessary: just <a href="https://github.com/fileformat/hackerlogos/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on github! 
Just so you know: I am usually using them on a credits page (<a href="http://www.numberplanet.com/support/credits.html">example</a>), so it might be in your best interests to let me slide.  
Alternatively, it would be great if you provided the appropriately sized images yourself.
