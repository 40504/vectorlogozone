        <h3>Can I use these images without royalties/attribution/etc?  Do you even have the authority to grant me such rights?</h3>
	<p>I am not the copyright/trademark/etc owner of any of these.  Use them at your own risk.</p>
	<p>If you are the owner and do not want your logo here, please let me know (nicely) and I will be glad to remove it.  
	No lawyers necessary: just <a href="https://github.com/fileformat/vectorlogozone/issues/new">submit an issue</a> on github!
	Just so you know: I am usually using them on a credits page (<a href="http://www.numberplanet.com/support/credits.html">example</a>), so it might be in your best interests to let me slide.  
	Alternatively, it would be great if you provided the appropriately sized images yourself.</p>

        <h3>Can I hotlink the images, or do I have to make my own copy?</h3>
        <p>I originally wasn't going to allow hotlinking, but CloudFlare promises unlimited free bandwidth, so I changed my
	   mind.  Unless CloudFlare changes their mind, hotlink away!</p>

        <h3>Why only vector images? </h3>
        <p>Vector images look so much better, especially on high-resolution displays, and don't require any of the 
	   hacks needed for responsive images: they &ldquo;just work&rdquo;!</p>

        <h3>Will my users be able to see them?</h3>

        <h3>How reliable is the site?  Can I count on it to be up all the time?</h3>
        <p>It is a static site, so it should be quite reliable.  You can check the <a href="https://nodeping.com/reports/checks/wbe44oj5-13fx-4h6l-8ojp-tlbno9b01gmu">recent uptime report</a> to see for yourself!</p>
        <p>That said, there are no guarantees.  Feel free to host the images you use on your own servers.</p>

        <h3>These images suck!  Can't you do any better?</h3>
        <p>I am definitely <i>not</i> an artist, and generally do not do anything besides resize and rearrange existing artwork.</p>
        <p>It can often be difficult to get the images to looks nice on their own and look good and consistant with the rest of the images.</p>
