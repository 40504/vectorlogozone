Ruby is really on the ball.  They have their own [Visual Identity Team](http://rubyidentity.org/) with a downloadable logo kit!

It looks like they were created with Adobe Illustrator on a Mac, but the authors included a PDF that I imported into Inkscape.

The font is [Georgia](http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/ascender/georgia/regular/?refby=vectorlogozone).
